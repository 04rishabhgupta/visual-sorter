# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! Ever wondered how sorting algorithms work? Now you can watch them in action with this interactive visualizer. It‚Äôs the perfect tool for anyone who wants to see how different sorting algorithms operate‚Äîand for those who just enjoy watching random bars swap places.

## üöÄ Features

- **Algorithms**: Visualizes Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the sorting speed from "Slow" to "Very Fast" (because who needs patience?).
- **Custom Array Size**: Choose the number of elements to sort and watch the chaos unfold.
- **Real-Time Updates**: See each step of the sorting process with real-time visual updates.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the page.
- **CSS**: Styling to make the visualizer look good.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for sorting algorithms and interactivity.
